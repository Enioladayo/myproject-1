### Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a retail company over 4 years (2011 - 2014). By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations,and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales data: The primary data set used for the analysis is the "data_Analysis_office_supply.csv" file, containing detailed information about sales made by the company

### Tools

- Excel (Data cleaning)
- Canva (Presentation slides)
- Tableau (Creating visuals)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as: 
1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. Which products are top sellers and least sellers?
3. How the profit margin progressed each year?

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:

- The Company's profit margin steadily increased over the years but experienced a decrease in 2014, which is the year in focus.
- The highest selling product was at a low profit margin and vice versa.
- Products with low sales amount had higher quantity being sold and vice versa

### Recommendations
1. Marketing and pricing systems should be reviewed on both the highest and lowest selling products to create a balance in the profit margin.
2. Marketing strategies should be  reviewed to put products with low quantity being sold in front of the right audience.
